<P><i>Chance The Rapper</i> is Ariana favorite artist. Chance comes from my very own city. Even though he is only 20 I can tell he will be around for a long time. His album <i>10 Day</i> is his first and his best so far. One of my favorite songs is featered by him <i>Confident</i> by Justin Bieber</P>
